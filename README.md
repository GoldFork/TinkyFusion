# TinkyFusion
The fusion of Tom and Inky into their true form, Tinky!!!

<h2>Rundown</h2>
So this is a little program that just calls 2 windows (1 Tom window and 1 Inky window) and makes them move towards eachother while the Krabby Patty secret formula presenting sound effect plays as the windows approach eachother. Once the windows meet the both close and a third window is opened with the fusion, Tinky. The program fully closes by closing any one of the windows. Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is required to run, it is part of the Java Development Kit (JDK) if you have that installed, or it can be installed independantly.
